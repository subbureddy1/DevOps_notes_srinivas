## CICD (CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION AND CONTINUOUS DELIVERY)

### CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
### Improves quality
improves the quality by running multiple unit tests and analysis various static code

### Increases productivity
automating build of code saves a lot of time thereby increasing productivity

### Reduces risk 
eliminate the risk of potential human errors by automating test.

## Introduction to Jenkins
### features of jenkins
easy installation process

upgrades are easily available

provides advance security

lightweight container support

optimized performance 

distributed team management

### what is continuous integration
 process of automating the build and testing of code each time one of the team member commits changes to version control.

 CI: CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
 CD: CONTINUOUS DELIVERY
   : CONTINUOUS DEPLOYMENT
delivery also knows release

CICD TOOLS:
Gitlab ci
code ship
bambo
jenkins
teamcity
travis ci

## from aws cloud:
if we wanted to perform cicd there are various services like code commit, code deploy, code build, code pipeline, code guru

## from azure cloud:
azure repos, boards, pipeline, test plans, artifacts

## what is jenkins
A continuous integration server which manages and control proceses such as plan, code, build, test, deploy, operate and monitors in devops environment.

## Why Jenkins is so popular?
- Open source
- Good plugin support
- Good community support
- Fast and reliable
- Good OS support
- Scripted builds

## Topics
Following are the topics covered in this module:

- **Jenkins Architecture**
- **Plugin Management in Jenkins**
- **Jenkins Security Management**
- **Notification in Jenkins**
- **Jenkins Master-Slave Architecture**
- **Jenkins Delivery Pipeline**
- **Jenkins Declarative Pipeline**

## Plugin Management in Jenkins
### Plugin: 
To have extra functionality

### Tabs:
- **Update**: Shows updates to plugins already installed
- **Available**: Shows plugins that are available for installation
- **Installed**: Displays plugins installed that have no updates
- **Advanced**: Lists configuration of HTTP proxy, allows manual upload of plugin and URL of plugin site

In real-time, we cannot install plugins as simple as that because there might be challenges with proxy settings as well as VPN (Virtual Private Network). To avoid this, we should configure HTTP proxy in Jenkins plugin of the advanced tab.
