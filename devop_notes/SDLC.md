# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## 1) Traditional Waterfall Model

1. **Requirements and Gathering Analysis:** Understanding customer requirements.
2. **Design:** Using tools and implementing CI/CD pipelines.
3. **Implementation:**
   - Coding
   - Unit testing
   - System testing
   - Regression testing (Longest duration phase)
4. **Testing:** User Acceptance Testing (UAT).
5. **Deployment:** Releasing the application.
6. **Maintenance:** Bug fixes and support.

## 2) What is Agile Methodology?

1. In Agile methodology, each project is broken into several **"iterations"**.
2. All iterations should have the same time duration (2 to 8 weeks).
3. At the end of each iteration, a working product is delivered.

**MVP (Minimum Viable Product):** A product with the minimum set of features needed to satisfy early adopters.

## 3) Limitations of Agile

- **Development team wants change**, while **Operation team wants stability**.
- Development team says: "The code works fine on my laptop."
- Operation team says: "There is some problem with the code; it does not work in production."

## 4) Why DevOps?

### Development without DevOps Culture:
- Release and deploy mismatch.
- Blame game between teams.
- Unpredictable issues.
- Lack of monitoring.

### Development with DevOps Culture:
1. **Streamlined Deliveries.**
2. **Team Collaboration.**
3. **Continuous Monitoring and Feedback.**

## 5) What Needs to Be Done?

### For Developers:
- Use a system with little or no waiting time.
- Use a system with updated code.

### For Operations:
- Ensure the system is up and running most of the time.
- Provide a system that is easy to administer.
- Implement effective monitoring and feedback.
- Establish robust systems.

## 6) What DevOps Is Not:

- DevOps is not a role, person, or organization.
- DevOps is not a separate team.
- DevOps is not a product or a tool.
- DevOps is not just about writing scripts or implementing tools.

---

## 7) What is DevOps?

DevOps is a **practice** that allows a single team to manage the entire application development life cycle, including:
- Development
- Testing
- Deployment
- Monitoring

## 8) What Does DevOps Do?

DevOps integrates developers and operations teams to improve collaboration and productivity by:
1. Automating infrastructure.
2. Automating workflows.
3. Continuously measuring application performance.
